#### usage of BS Lower/Upper bound:
##### In an ascending array, number of elements what I'm looking for can be calculated through index.
#

#### Here's ans example of an array.
##### el : 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 5 5 
##### idx: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
#
##### In this array above, number of element 2 is idx 6- idx 2- 4.
###### note: This method is alike counting numbers in range [2,6): 6-2= 4.
#
#
##### Since both upper bound and lower bound should be found individually, 
##### two separate binary searching loop should be implemented.
#
#
#
##### There are several elements that should always be considered when implementing BS loop.
#

> #### 1: When should the loop be breaked?
> #### 2. When loop is breaked, where is the answer located?
#

#### consideration) 1. loop should be breaked when there are no ways left to narrow the gap.
###### The concept of binary search is narrowing down the range(by half) where answer can be located
###### By simply knowing the process of BS, it can be misunderstood that the gap can be always narrowed to 1.
###### But there is a problem: binary searched array idxs are integer: so middle of 0 and 1 is not 0.5; it is 0. (0+1)//2= 1
##
##
##### so when gap is 2 and lo heads to mid, binary loop should be breaked and answer should be found by checking remaing 2 elements individually.
##### When gap is 2 and lo heads to mid+1, binary loop should be breaked automatically !
#
#### consideration) 2. When loop is breaked, where is the answer located?
###### If the goal doesn't exists, the idx that is pointed should be manually am

###### note: This problem has no additioanl processing of each element, so 
###### it is better to use dictionary: just save each existing value and its amount.
###### Since nlogn (sorting) is needed in order to use binary search, 
###### binary search is not the optimal strategy for this problem.
