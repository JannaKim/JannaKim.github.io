## difficulty: Silver 2

## Problem description
### There exists 3 rods: 1, 2 and 3.
### The goal is to move all stencils from rod 1 to rod 3.

## input(s)
### n: number of stencils piled up on rod 1

## print out(s):
### 1. number of moves
### 2. state all process (moved -> piled) for all movement, in order




# idea) 2. state all process (moved -> piled) for all movement, in order

### if n>=2, 3 steps should carried out necessarily.

### before, 
### set mid rod.
### condition: mid rod != start rod and mid rod != end rod. 
#### (Since there are only 3 rods, mid rod is always the remaining 1 rod.)

## Step 1: move all stencils except the bottommost(largest) one to mid rod
## Step 2: move the bottommost(largest) stencil at start rod to end rod
## Step 3: move all stencils piled in mid rod to end rod


# note: if all steps above are neccessary in all n>=2: reusing same function is possible:



# WHY reuse function if DP is possible?
## bottom up DP is impossible because the PROCESS is same, but starting, ending, mid rod DIFFERS.
## by reusing function, same process can be implemented; ONLY DIFFERING STARTING, ENDING, MID RODS.




# idea) 1. number of moves
## number of movement can be calculated with DP, since mentioning starting, ending, mid rod is unnecessary.

### dp[1]=1
### dp[n]= dp[n-1]+ 1+ dp[n-1] = 1+ 2*dp[n-1]

# note: equation above is recurrence relation
