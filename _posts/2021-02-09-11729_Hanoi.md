### Order of Hanoi
##### URL https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11729
##### difficulty: __Silver 2__


> ### Problem description
> #### There exists 3 rods: 1, 2 and 3.
> #### The goal is to move all stencils from rod 1 to rod 3.
> 
> > #### input(s)
> > ##### n: number of stencils piled up on rod 1
>
> > #### print out(s):
> > ##### 1. number of moves
> > ##### 2. state all process (moved -> piled) for all movement, in order

#### idea) 2. state all process (moved -> piled) for all movement, in order

#### if n>=2, 3 steps should carried out __necessarily__.

##### before, 
##### set mid rod.
##### condition: mid rod != start rod and mid rod != end rod. 
###### (Since there are only 3 rods, mid rod is always the remaining 1 rod.)

> #### Step 1: move all stencils except the bottommost(largest) one to mid rod
> #### Step 2: move the bottommost(largest) stencil at start rod to end rod
> #### Step 3: move all stencils piled in mid rod to end rod


###### note: if all steps above are neccessary in all n>=2: __reusing same function is possible__.



##### __WHY reuse function__ if DP is possible?
###### bottom up DP is impossible because the PROCESS is same, but __starting, ending, mid rod DIFFERS__.
###### by reusing function, same process can be implemented; ONLY DIFFERING STARTING, ENDING, MID RODS.



* * *

#### idea) 1. number of moves
###### number of movement can be calculated with DP, since __mentioning starting, ending, mid rod is unnecessary__.

#### __dp[1]=1__
#### __dp[n]__= dp[n-1]+ 1+ dp[n-1] __= 1+ 2*dp[n-1]__

###### note: equation above is __recurrence relation__
