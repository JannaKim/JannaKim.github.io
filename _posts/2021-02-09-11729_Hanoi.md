### Order of Hanoi
##### URL https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11729
##### difficulty: __Silver 2__
#
#
> ### Problem description
> #### There exists 3 rods: 1, 2 and 3.
> #### The goal is to move all stencils from rod 1 to rod 3.
> 
> > #### input(s)
> > ##### n: number of stencils piled up on rod 1
>
> > #### print out(s):
> > ##### 1. number of moves
> > ##### 2. state all process (from moved rod to piled rod) for all movements, in order

* * *
#
#
#### idea) 2. state all process (moved -> piled) for all movements, in order

> #### * [main idea]: if n>=2, 3 steps should be carried out __necessarily__.

##### First, set mid rod(m).
#####   condition: m != starting rod and m != arriving rod. 
######  (Since there are only 3 rods, m should always be the remaining one.)
#
> #### Step 1: move all stencils except the bottommost(largest) one to mid rod
> #### Step 2: move the bottommost(largest) stencil at start rod to end rod
> #### Step 3: move all stencils piled in mid rod to end rod
#

###### note: if all steps above are neccessary in all n>=2: __reusing same function is possible__.


##### __WHY reuse function__ if DP is possible?
######    bottom up DP is impossible because the PROCESS is same, but __starting, ending, and m DIFFERS__.
###### Thus by reusing function, same process can be implemented: ONLY DIFFERING STARTING, ENDING and MID ROD.

#
* * *
#
#### idea) 1. number of moves
###### number of movement can be calculated with DP, since __mentioning starting, ending, mid rod is unnecessary__.

#### __dp[1]=1__
#### __dp[n]__= dp[n-1]+ 1+ dp[n-1] __= 1+ 2*dp[n-1]__

###### note: equation above is __recurrence relation__, since the simplest form of a recurrence relation is the case where the next term depends only on the immediately previous term.

#
##### Thus, number of moves are: __2^n-1__
#
#

#### code ver 1) deliver 3 paratemeters: starting, arriving and mid rod
#### Count num of movements by bottom-up DP.
