### difficulty: __Silver 2__

### Problem description
#### There exists 3 rods: 1, 2 and 3.
#### The goal is to move all stencils from rod 1 to rod 3.

### input(s)
#### n: number of stencils piled up on rod 1

### print out(s):
#### 1. number of moves
#### 2. state all process (moved -> piled) for all movement, in order

* * *


## idea) 2. state all process (moved -> piled) for all movement, in order

#### if n>=2, 3 steps should carried out __necessarily__.

#### before, 
#### set mid rod.
#### condition: mid rod != start rod and mid rod != end rod. 
##### (Since there are only 3 rods, mid rod is always the remaining 1 rod.)

### Step 1: move all stencils except the bottommost(largest) one to mid rod
### Step 2: move the bottommost(largest) stencil at start rod to end rod
### Step 3: move all stencils piled in mid rod to end rod


## note: if all steps above are neccessary in all n>=2: __reusing same function is possible__.



## __WHY reuse function__ if DP is possible?
#### bottom up DP is impossible because the PROCESS is same, but __starting, ending, mid rod DIFFERS__.
#### by reusing function, same process can be implemented; ONLY DIFFERING STARTING, ENDING, MID RODS.




## idea) 1. number of moves
### number of movement can be calculated with DP, since __mentioning starting, ending, mid rod is unnecessary__.

#### dp[1]=1
#### dp[n]= dp[n-1]+ 1+ dp[n-1] = 1+ 2*dp[n-1]

## note: equation above is __recurrence relation__
